# Tutorial - User Guide - Intro

This tutorial will show you how to use **Py2K** and it's features in a step-by-step manner.

All the Python code in the tutorial should run as-is in your environment, provided you have the correct configurations for your Kafka cluster.

## Run the code

All the code blocks can be copied and used directly (they are actually tested Python files).

These can be run by copying the files into any python file, call it `py2k_test.py` and run it with `python py2k_test.py`.

This will show you how easy it is to use **Py2K** with its minimal code style.
